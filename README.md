# Two Pointer Pattern Article
>Two pointer algorithm pattern is one of the most commonly asked questions in any programming interview. In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or Linked List) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray. 
# This pattern has three main steps:
- Pointer Initialization: Starting points. Pointers can be at any place depending upon what we are trying to achieve.
- Pointer movement: This will decide how we converge towards the solution. Pointers can move in the same direction or they can move in the opposite direction.
- Stop Condition: This decides when do we need to stop.
